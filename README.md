## Euclidean Algorithm using RISC-V instruction set

### Program Descritption

An implementation of [Euclidean Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) to calculate the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor#:~:text=If%20d%20is%20a%20common,divisors%2C%20or%20none%20at%20all.)) of two numbers that are stored in RAM.

### Notes

- The program was assembled and tested using RISC-V Runtime Simulator ([RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars)).
